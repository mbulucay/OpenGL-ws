What is glViewport for and why it is not necessary sometimes?

1)
I'll tell you why do we really need glViewport function.
In typical rendering it may seem to have no sense - you just create some window or render target and draw on it, right? 
I'd say that 95+% of apps works that way.
But let's say your're writing an app like 3DS MAX, where you have you window split into 4 distinct renderings. 
You remember your current split position and you manage Mouse events, 
so when you hover over the split bar you may change mouse cursor to resizing one, etc. 
When you drag your split bar you remember its new position and so on.
When you want to render your 3D views you cal glViewport with position and size of your first 3D-subwindow and run typical GL commands 
to draw here. OpenGL will automatically scale the rendering so it fits into the given viewport.
You do the same for the rest of your viewports and at the end you get one window with few different renderings, 
each with its own parameters. This way you can have as many distinct renderings on single window/render target as you want.

2) 
glViewport lets opengl know how to map the NDC coordinates to the framebuffer coordinates.
By default it is set to the full size of the screen buffer. 
So you only need to call it when the window gets resized or you actually want to change it.
